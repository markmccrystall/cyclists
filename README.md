# Cycle Counts in Dublin City Centre

In this notebook I explore a [dataset](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/dublin-city-centre-cycle-counts) published by Dublin City Council detailing the number of cyclists measured by totem counters at several locations in the city.
I also make use of a [dataset](https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data) containing hourly data from a weather station in Phoenix Park, obtained from Met Ã‰ireann's website.
